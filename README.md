# aoc-leaderboard-bot

This bot is made for zekros DevSchuppen. It uses the advent of code API to get the newest statistics of the Leaderboard.
The codebase is shitty and comments are missing. 

## Usage
This bot is only running at the time of the advent of code event. Therefore it is not worth to make the codebase greater.
It will only be modified for the advent of code events.
